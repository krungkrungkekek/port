                <h2>PORK ADOBO.</h2><br>
                <p><b>Pork Adobo is definitely a favorite among many around the world. For this, we cook pork slices in
                        a
                        perfect mix of soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic to make this savory and sour viand. And I’ve got
                        to
                        say,
                        it’s definitely a great way to introduce the world to what Pinoy cooks can make! But actually,
                        there
                        are other renditions of adobo.</b>

            <p>Here are the ingredients needed to cook PORK ADOBO</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pork belly – For a juicy, meaty dish!.</li>
                <li>Garlic – Makes for the most savory stew..</li>
                <li>Dried bay leaves – Gives off the perfect adobo aroma.</li>
                <li>Vinegar – Part of what makes adobo so brilliantly unique is its sourness, which we get from vinegar.
                </li>
                <li>Soy sauce – There’s nothing quite like the salty quality of soy sauce!.</li>
                <li>Peppercorn – Just for the slightest bit of spice!.</li>
                <li>Water – As this has a stew, we will definitely be using plenty of water!.</li>
                <li>Salt – And to make sure everything is nice and flavorful, you will be using some salt too.</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>PORK SINIGANG.</h2><br>
                <p><b>Sinigang is a classic Filipino soup characterized by its sour and savory medley of flavors. It's
                        popular comfort food in the Philippines, usually served on its own or paired with steamed rice
                        on rainy days to ward off the cold.

                        Like adobo, the term sinigang describes a cooking method more than a particular dish, as it has
                        many variations.
                        It can be made with protein such as pork, fish, shrimp, beef, and chicken and souring agents
                        such as tamarind, guava, green mango, calamansi, kamias, batuan, santol, and other native
                        fruits.</b>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p>Here are the ingredients needed to cook PORK SINIGANG</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pork-while you can use meatier and leaner parts such as pork shoulder (kasim), I recommend bony cuts
                    such as spare ribs, pork belly with ribs, hocks, knuckles, and tailbone or neck bones for better
                    flavor.</li>
                <li>Tomatoes- use ripe, juicy tomatoes</li>
                <li>Onion-peeled and quartered</li>
                <li>Fish sauce- brings umami flavor; you can swap it with salt if you prefer</li>
                <li>Gabi- adds a starchy component to the dish and thickens the broth</li>
                <li>Radish (labanos)</li>
                <li>Vegetables- the recipe uses sitaw (long beans), eggplant, okra, and bok choy, but feel free to
                    include other local produce available such as kangkong (water spinach) and pechay</li>
                <li>Tamarind- can be fresh pods, paste, or powder mixes</li>
                <li>Banana or finger chili peppers (siling haba)-adds a mild heat; optional and can be omitted</li>
            </ul>

                <p><b>Pinakbet, a traditional Filipino vegetable stew, is characterized by its use of a variety of
                        locally sourced vegetables,
                        a fermented seafood-infused broth (bagoong), and a slow-simmered cooking method that allows
                        flavors to meld.Pinakbet named after the Ilocano word pinakebbet, which means “dwindled” or
                        reduced in size. This is because the method of cooking Pinakbet ends up with the ingredients
                        shriveled. Slicing up the ampalaya into quarters usually provides more salt for the ingredients,
                        which leads to the vegetables toughening and shrinking.
                        In the end, you get spoonfuls of deliciously complementary vegetables, crispy meat and a savory,
